#Hip Hop Dance Competition Database

In this website, I will be creating a database of hip hop dance competitions. The data would include the competition name, the YouTube video link, the year of the competition, the dance team, the songs within the set, and the placing. I hope to have others who are more knowledgeable about these competitions to help me fill in information and to make this a collaborative effort. Hope you enjoy!
